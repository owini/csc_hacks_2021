# Trader's Edge - CSC Hacks Project Repo

This repo is an example of a team project repository that meets all of [the repository requirements](https://www.notion.so/CSC-Hacks-901a62e005c8494fa342e0cc738101ad#da206965e3ed497f9bd6c1ceebd4fac9).

## Project Description

A financial web application where users can compare their stock portfolios to top investors and find key insights into their performance.

## MVP

Figma Prototype: https://www.figma.com/proto/Di1qh4AvzY2R4hJUxbKmZD/CSC-Hacks-2021?page-id=2187%3A5610&node-id=2193%3A5664&viewport=241%2C48%2C0.64&scaling=scale-down&starting-point-node-id=2193%3A5664

1. Open Figma prototype using link.
2. Navigate by clicking the next and back buttons (dropdown also interactive).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.
